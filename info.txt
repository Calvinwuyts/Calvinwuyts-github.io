todo:
- jquery for navbar
- make it work in firefox! window.location.search works differently in firefox -_-
- create a listener to see which browser is used. Create an alert for if the user isn't on firefox or chrome.
- make it work in safari. it doesn't like urlsearchparams
- create the featured search: have it look at a url in a text file that can be changed easily, so you don't have to update the whole .js file
every time you make a new channel featured.
